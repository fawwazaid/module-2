## About the website

The website showcases a web developer's page with a strong interest in machine learning. Its structure comprises both the head and body sections, with the body divided into distinct segments: header, main content, and footer. Within the main content area, HTML elements are styled to enhance presentation, including tables for organizing information and a form for user interaction.
